## Verification Vs. Validation

Verification:

- The verifying process includes checking documents, design, code, and program.
- It does not involve executing the code.
- Verification uses methods like reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and desk- checking, etc.
- It finds bugs early in the development cycle.
- Target is application and software architecture, specification, complete design, high level, and database design.
- QA team does verification and make sure that the software is as per the requirement in the SRS document.
- It comes before validation.

Validation:

- It is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating the actual product.
- It always involves executing the code.
- It uses methods like Black Box Testing, White Box Testing, and non-functional testing.
- It can find bugs that the verification process can not catch
- Target is an actual product.
- With the involvement of testing team validation is executed on software code.
- It comes after verification.

## Example of verification and validation:
Suppose specification is "A clickable button with the name Submet."
- "Verification" would check the design doc and correcting the spelling mistake.
- Otherwise, the development team will create a button like "Submet"
- So new specification is "A clickable button with the name Submit."

Once the code is ready, a validation test found. "Button is not clickable."
- In the validation process, the development team will make the submit button clickable.
