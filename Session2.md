## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- After delivering the project to the end-user, they are not using directly on the production server, 
they need to perform some testing before going live.
- At that time, the end-user perform some test cases on the project/application. It is known as User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
- After UAT is done successfully, then and then only the customer deploys application in the production environment.
- It is a kind of black box testing where two or more end-users will be involved.

## Who performs the UAT?
- Client
- End users

## Need of User Acceptance Testing

- Developers code software based on requirements document which is their "own" understanding of the requirements and may not actually be what the client needs from the software.
- Requirements changes during the course of the project may not be communicated effectively to the developers.

## SDLC V-Model
The V-model is a type of SDLC model where process executes in a sequential manner in V-shape. It is also known as Verification and Validation model. It is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage.

Verification: It involves static analysis technique (review) done without executing code. It is the process of evaluation of the product development phase to find whether specified requirements meet.

Validation: It involves dynamic analysis technique (functional, non-functional), testing done by executing code. Validation is the process to evaluate the software after the completion of the development phase to determine whether software meets the customer expectations and requirements.
