## What is Software? <br />
It is a collection of programs that performs a specific task.<br />

## What is Testing?<br />
Testing is nothing but identifies or detects the defects or bugs from the software.<br />

## Goal of the testing <br />
The ultimate goal of the testing is to deliver the quality product to the customer.<br />

## What is Defect/Bug?<br />
It is the functionality which is not worked as expected or not worked as client requirements.

## Product vs. Project<br />
- If the company(Service Based Company) develops software for the specific customer, then it is called as 'Project.'<br />
e.g., Wipro, Persistent, Infosys, etc. companies are service-based companies.<br />
- If the company(Product Based Company) develops software based on analysis of the market requirements, 
then it is called as 'Product.'<br />
e.g., Krishagni, Google, Microsoft, etc. companies are product-based companies.<br />

## What is SDLC?<br />
Entire development os the software, in which software is going through multiple phases or multiple processes, <br />
which is called as 'SDLC' process.<br />

## SDLC Phases<br />
- Requirement Gathering<br />
- Design<br />
- Coding<br />
- Testing<br />
- Deployment<br />
- Maintenance <br />
In the 4th phase, STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle) comes into the picture. The reason for STLC is, <br />
we need to deliver the quality product to the client.<br />

## STLC phases<br />
- Requirement Analysis − In this phase, the testing team starts high-level analysis concerning the application under test.<br />
- Test Planning − Test Team plans the strategy and approach.<br />
- Test Case Designing − Develop the test cases based on scope and criteria.<br />
- Test Environment Setup − In this phase, the integrated environment is ready to validate the product.<br />
- Test Execution − In this phase, the real-time validation of the product and finding bugs is completed.<br />
- Test Closure − Once testing is completed, reports, results of testing are documented.<br />

## Types of testing<br />
White box testing: (Internal Testing)<br />
- White box testing is the testing of a software's internal structure, design, and coding.<br />
- In this type of testing, the code is visible to the tester.<br />
- It focuses primarily on verifying the flow of inputs and outputs through the application.<br />
- Developers usually perform it.<br />
- Unit testing and integration testing are types of white box testing.<br />
Black box testing: (Functionality Testing)<br />
- Black box testing is the testing technique in which functionality of the application is tested without looking <br />
at the internal code structure, implementation details, and knowledge of internal paths of the software.<br />
- This type of testing is based entirely on software requirements and specifications.<br />
- In Black Box Testing, we focus on inputs and output of the software system without bothering about internal knowledge 
of the software program.<br />
- Testers usually perform it.<br />
- System testing and user acceptance testing are types of black box testing.<br />

## What are the role of developer or programmer in testing?<br />
- Unit and integration testing is done by developer.<br />
- Requirement -> Write a program -> doing unit testing.<br />
- Unit Testing: Testing of internal logic of program is called as unit testing.<br />
For example: Give input to the program an check the output is as expected or not or do the conditional testing.<br />
- Integration Testing: Suppose there are multiple modules/code blocks presen, for example output of module 1 is input of <br />
module 2 and output of module 2 is input of module 3 and so on. Developer needs to check the communication between <br />
these modules that is called as integration testing.<br />
- Also provide build in executable form to the tester, so tester can do the further testing.<br />

## What are the role of tester in testing?<br />
- Read all the documents and understand what needs to be tested.<br />
- Based on the information got in the above step decide how it is to be tested.<br />
- Inform the test lead about what all resources will be required for software testing.<br />
- Develop test cases and prioritize testing activities.<br />
- Execute all the test case and report defects, define severity and priority for each defect.<br />
- Carry out regression testing every time when changes are made to the code to fix defects.<br />

## What is Test Cases?<br />
- It means acttion perform on the application.<br />
for example: <br />
Test case: Test login page<br />
Steps to do the testing:<br />
- open application<br />
- click on sign in<br />
- enter user name<br />
- enter password<br />
- go to the home page<br />
