## Verification Strategies: Reviews, Walkthroughs and Inspections 

## Review

The focus of the review is on a work product (e.g., Requirements document, Code, etc.). After the work product is <br />
developed, the Project Leader calls for a Review. The work product is distributed to the person who involves in the review.<br />
The main audience for the review should be the Project Manager, Project Leader, and the Producer of the work product. <br />
Major reviews include the following:<br />
1. In Process Reviews<br />
2. Decision Point or Phase End Reviews<br />
3. Post Implementation Reviews<br />

As per statistics, Reviews uncover over 65% of the defects, and testing uncovers around 30%. So, it’s very important <br />
to maintain reviews as part of the V&V(verification and Validation) strategies.<br />

1. In-Process Review: In-Process Review looks at the product during a specific time period of a life cycle, such as activity.<br /> 
They are usually limited to a segment of a project, with the goal of identifying defects as work progresses, rather than <br />
at the close of a phase or even later, when they are more costly to correct.<br />

2. Phase-End Review: This review looks at the product for the main purpose of determining whether to <br />
continue with planned activities. They are held at the end of each phase in a semiformal or formal way. Defects found <br />
are tracked through resolution, usually by way of the existing defect tracking system. The common phase-end reviews <br />
are Software Requirements Review, Critical Design Review, and Test Readiness Review.<br />
– The Software Requirements Review is aimed at validating and approving the documented software requirements for <br />
the purpose of establishing a baseline and identifying analysis packages. The Development Plan, Software Test Plan,<br /> 
Configuration Management Plan are some of the document reviews during this phase.<br />
– The Critical Design Review baselines the detailed design specification. Test cases are reviewed and approved.<br />
– The Test Readiness Review is performed when the appropriate application components are near complete. This <br />
review will determine the readiness of the application for system and acceptance testing.<br />

3. Post Implementation Review: These reviews are held after implementation is complete with auditing the process based <br />
on actual results. Post-Implementation reviews are also known as Postmortems and are held to assess the success of <br />
the overall process after release and identify any opportunities for process improvement. They can be held up to three <br />
to six months after implementation, and are conducted in a format.<br />

## Inspections

A knowledgeable individual called a moderator, who is not a member of the team or the author of the product under review, <br />
facilitates inspections. A recorder which records the defects found and actions assigned assists the moderator. <br />
The meeting is planned in advance, and material is distributed to all the participants, and the participants are expected <br />
to attend the meeting well prepared. The issues raised during the meeting are documented and circulated among the <br />
members present and the management.<br />

## Walkthroughs

The author of the material being reviewed facilitates Walkthrough. The participants are led through the material <br />
in one of two formats; the presentation is made without interruptions, and comments are made at the end, or <br />
comments are made throughout. In either case, the issues raised are captured and published in a report distributed <br />
to the participants. Possible solutions for uncovered defects are not discussed during the review.<br />
